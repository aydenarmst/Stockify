### ETF Holdings Overlap Finder

This project leverages the power of Django and React to provide a tool for analyzing the holdings of ETFs. It is specially designed to discover overlaps between multiple ETFs and offers a unique blend normalization feature.

### Features
- **ETF Holdings Analysis:** Deep dive into the holdings of various ETFs and identify which securities they have in common.
- **Blend Normalization:** Adjust the weightings of the holdings in a custom blend to see how the portfolio makeup changes.
- **Data Updates:** The dataset is sourced from iShares, ensuring you're working with high-quality and up-to-date information.
