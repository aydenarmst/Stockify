# Stockify: Comprehensive ETF Analysis Toolkit

'Stockify' is built upon the robustness of Django and the flexibility of React, offering an intricate tool dedicated to unraveling the overlaps in ETF holdings. Its design is tailored to:

1. Procure all ETF data, currently exclusive to iShares, and sustain an efficient database of these acquisitions.
2. Aggregate, standardize, and revamp the list of holdings, representing the proportionate share of each constituent stock.
3. Equip users with the capability to downscale or exclude specific sectors from ETF holdings.

## Why Stockify?
The curious absence of this utility from brokerage platforms, combined with the deliberate barriers set up against scraping ETF holdings, sparked the creation of 'Stockify'. This platform aims to be the go-to solution for a broad spectrum of usersâ€”DIY investors, novices, retirement account holders, and financial advisors. It reshapes the way Exchange-Traded Funds are viewed and allocated, catering to specific needs.
